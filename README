This is a C++ test application implementing a very simple stock analyzer.

It uses standard C++ libraries plus Boost for Regex, Unit Testing and some string handling.

It is currently aimed at Linux machines and builds using autoconf - see INSTALL.

Once built and installed, rsST will run all unit tests and rsS will run the analyzer.

It currently just implements a simple loop. Type a command to get the action you want: register a trade or
view some statistic about a stock or and aggregate value, follow the prompt to enter the required details: stock code,
price etc, if required.
